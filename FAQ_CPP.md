##C++  
Difference between C++ and C ?
Is it possible to have unnamed class ?
Object of an empty class has non-zero size ?
What is the use of empty class ?
what is the size of a C++ empty class and C struct ?
When the size of operator is applied to a calss or union or struct the result is the number of bytes in an object  of that class, struct or union plus any padding added to align members on word boundry. ( The /Zp compiler option and the pack pragma affect alignment boundries for members ) The size of operator never yields ZERO even for an empty class.
What is reference variable ?
Where reference variable can declare without initialization ?
What is passing by value , passing by reference and passing by pointer ?
What is function overloading ?
What is operator overloading ?
Overloaded operator cannot have default argument ?
What operator are not permitted to overloaded ?
An operator function must either be a calss member or take at least one argument of a calss an enumeration, or reference of a class or enumeration ?
All overloaded operatos except assignment are inherited by derived class . Why not the assigned operator ?

Sequence of destructor call ?
What is virtual destructor and when we need that ? Why destructor are not virtual by default ?
 Is it possble to declare constructor as virtual ?
what is nesting class ?
what is pointer to derived class ?
Is it possible to initialize a base class pointer to a derived class pointer ? reverse is always true ?
a virtual function cannot be static ?
what is inline function ?
A virtual function can be constant ?
Is it possible to overload a const and non-constant function ?
a virtual function of one class can be friend of another class ?
A virtual function cannot be friend in the same scope ?
Summary of above two , only memeber function and base can be virtual
What ius static and dynamic casting ?
what ia adhoc or static polymorphism ?
what is static variable ?
when we need return type of a function as reference or pointer ?
what is deep copy ?
What is cello copy ?
what is container class ?
what is homogeneous and hetrogeneous container class ?
what is template class ?
what is template function
is it possible to call a non-static member function or assign a variable inside a static member function ?
which operator overloaded functions are generated by compiler by default ?
is it possible to convert a built-in type to class type ?
is it possible to convert a class type to built-in type ?
is it possible to make a publicly inherited function private in derived class ?
is it possible to make a protectedly inherited function private in derived class ?
is it possible to make a provately inherited function public in derived class ?
is it possible to change value of a member variable inside constant method ?
what is functor ?
what are the benifit of OOP ?
Is it possible / permitted to define pure virtul  function in the abstruct class , if yes give an example and where do we need that ?
Write a program in C++ which will print "Hello World"  where the main function of the program will be empty [main() {}]
Is it possible int x = f1(x) ; or f(int x, int y = x); < /FONT >
How many time of calling convention are used in  C and C++.
What is the calling convention of C++ class member function ?
in _cdecl calling conversion stack cleanup is done by caller , in _stdcall cleanup is done by calle, in fast call clean up is done by calle , in thiscall cleanup is done by calle.
in _cdecl calling convension parameters are pshed in the stack in the reverse order (right to left ) , in _stdcal paremeters are pushed in reverse order, in _fastcall parameters are stored in registers, then pushed on stack , in this call parameters are pushed in stack and this pointer stored in ECX register.
The _cdecl calling convension creates larger executables than _stdcall, because it requires each function call to include stack clean up code.
it is always possible to convert derived class pointer to base class pointer by implicit casting. Similarly, base class pointer to derived class pointer by explicit casting but for virtual base class the conversion requires reinterpret_cast .
is it possible to define a class inside a function (local class ) ?
overloaded operator new and delete are by default static if not declared explicitely. Why ?
What is singleton class
What is aggregate ?
What is directive ?
what is trigraph ?
Is it possibel to declare a class inside a function ?
Restriction of creation of class object
Is it possibel to take bit value in struct , class and / or union ?
is it possible to assign a character pointer to a character array ?
What is stack and what is heap ? In heap data is stored in binary tree form.  Heap data struct is also known as binary data structure.
What is virtual memory ?
What is runtype type information (RTTI ) . How to achieve this in C++.
Is it possible to call a member function through a pointer without allocated using new operator.
What is template ?
What is function overloading, overriding and function overwriting ?
In general C++ does not permit to overload base class function in derived class because these are in different scope. But can be overloaded using directive.
Is virtual key necessary in definition part of function ?
Is it necessary to define virtul function in base class.
Is static keyword necessary in definition part of static member function
is friend keyword.
Is inline keyword permit to make a function inline at the time of definition, so we can write inline keyword in definition part.
Is constant keyword ?
A constant function can be called by both const and non-const member object but a const object or pointer to a const object can call constant function because this pointer of const function is pointer to constant type.
what is nemaspace ?
is it possible to make reference of a null pointer ?
copy constructor of a derived class by default call default constructor of base class ?
It is possible to call destructor explicitely ?
Virtual base class must have a default constructor ?
